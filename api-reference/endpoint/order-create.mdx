The `/orders/create` endpoint supports three integration patterns depending on who implements and calls it.

## Integration Patterns

  <Card title="Merchant" icon="store" href="/api-reference/endpoint/order-create-merchant">
    Payment apps call merchants to get signed orders
  </Card>

  <Card title="Payment Gateway" icon="qrcode" href="/api-reference/endpoint/order-create-payment-gateway">
    Merchants post orders via QR code session URLs
  </Card>

  <Card title="Merchant Gateway" icon="arrow-right-to-bracket" href="/api-reference/endpoint/order-create-merchant-gateway">
    Merchants get redirect URLs for hosted payment
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
