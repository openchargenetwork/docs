<Note>
This endpoint is designed for small inventories such as vending machines or kiosks.
Payment apps call this endpoint to display available items before creating an order.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. Payment app scans a merchant's QR code or receives their OCID
2. Payment app fetches the merchant's inventory via this endpoint
3. User selects items from the displayed inventory
4. Payment app creates an order with the selected items using `/orders/create`

## Use Cases

- **Vending machines** - Display available snacks and drinks
- **Kiosks** - Show menu items at self-service stations
- **Small retail** - Present product catalog for quick purchases

## Stock Management

The `quantity` field indicates available stock. Payment apps should:

- Hide or disable items with `quantity: 0`
- Respect `min_qty` and `max_qty` constraints when building orders
- Refresh inventory before order submission to avoid stock conflicts
