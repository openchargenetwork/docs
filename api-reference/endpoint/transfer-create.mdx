## Identifying Parties

The `from` and `to` objects identify the sender and recipient of a transfer. While OCID is the primary identifier, merchant gateways may support additional identifiers for custom use cases.

### Primary Identifier

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ocid` | OpenCharge ID - the standard identifier for transfers between registered participants |

### Custom Identifiers

Merchant gateways may support additional identifiers depending on their capabilities. Merchants should confirm support with the merchant gateway before using these.

| Field | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| `phoneNumber` | Mobile money transfers, particularly in Africa and emerging markets where gateways can initiate transfers via separate authentication pipelines |
| `cryptoAddress` | Crypto gateways transferring to blockchain addresses |
| `bankAccount` | Direct bank credits between accounts |

<Warning>
When implementing custom identifiers, merchant gateways **must** obtain explicit consent from their end users (not merchants) before debiting accounts. The consent and authentication process is gateway-specific and beyond the scope of this documentation.
</Warning>
