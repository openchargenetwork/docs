description: "Return your gateway's public metadata for service discovery"
openapi: "GET /metadata.json"

<Info>
This endpoint is public and does not require authentication. Merchants and other services fetch this to discover your gateway's capabilities and verify your signatures.
</Info>

## Implementation

Host this endpoint at the URL you register in the Router Registry. The response tells merchants:

- **Your public key** - Used to verify your signed proofs
- **Your endpoint URL** - Where to send API requests
- **Your capabilities** - Which endpoints you support
- **Settlement preferences** - Which currencies and providers you accept

## Key Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `config.publicKey` | Your secp256k1 public key (128 hex chars) |
| `config.endpoint` | Base URL for your Opencharge API |
| `config.capabilities` | List of supported operations |
| `config.settlement.currencies` | ISO 4217 currency codes you support |
| `config.settlement.accepts` | OCIDs you accept for settlement proofs |
| `signature` | Your signature of the canonicalized config |

## Signing Your Config

Sign the `config` object to prove you control the private key:

```javascript
const config = {
  publicKey: YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY,
  endpoint: "https://pay.yourgateway.com/opencharge",
  capabilities: [
    "orders.checkout",
    "transfer.create",
    "transfer.webhook",
    "payment.create",
    "payment.settle",
    "verify.txid"
  ],
  settlement: {
    currencies: ["USD", "EUR"],
    accepts: [100, 101, 102]
  }
};

const canonical = JSON.stringify(config, Object.keys(config).sort());
const signature = secp256k1_sign(YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY, SHA256(canonical));
```
