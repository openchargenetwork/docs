title: "Get Capabilities"
description: "Return partner-specific capabilities and permissions for authenticated callers"
openapi: "merchant-api/openapi.json GET /capabilities"
---

<Info>
Unlike the public `/metadata.json`, this authenticated endpoint returns capabilities specific to the requesting OCID based on your service preferences or partnership agreements.
</Info>

## Use Cases

Use this endpoint to provide differentiated access:

- **Preferred partners** - Grant additional capabilities to strategic partners
- **Restricted access** - Limit certain OCIDs to specific operations
- **Custom settlement** - Offer different settlement options per partner

## Example Response

```json
{
  "ocid": 500,
  "name": "Coffee Shop",
  "capabilities": [
    "orders.create",
    "orders.status",
    "transfer.webhook"
  ],
  "settlement": {
    "currencies": ["USD"],
    "accepts": [100, 101]
  }
}
```

## Authentication

Verify the request signature using the caller's public key from their `/metadata.json` endpoint. See [Request Authentication](/guides/protocol/request-authentication) for details.
