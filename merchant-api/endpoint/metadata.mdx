title: "Get Metadata"
description: "Return your service's public metadata including public key, endpoint URL, and capabilities"
openapi: "GET /metadata.json"
---

<Info>
This endpoint is public and does not require authentication. Other services fetch this to discover how to interact with your merchant and verify your signatures.
</Info>

## Implementation

Host this endpoint at the URL you register in the Router Registry smart contract. The response tells other services:

- **Your public key** - Used to verify signatures on orders you create
- **Your endpoint URL** - Where to send API requests
- **Your capabilities** - Which endpoints you support
- **Settlement preferences** - Which currencies and settlement providers you accept

## Example Response

```json
{
  "opencharge": "0.1",
  "name": "Coffee Shop",
  "description": "Local coffee shop accepting Opencharge payments",
  "icon": "https://merchant.example/icon.png",
  "config": {
    "publicKey": "a34b5c6d7e8f9a0b...",
    "endpoint": "https://api.merchant.example/opencharge",
    "capabilities": [
      "orders.create",
      "orders.status",
      "transfer.webhook"
    ],
    "settlement": {
      "currencies": ["USD"],
      "accepts": [100, 101, 102]
    }
  },
  "signature": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...7f1b",
  "contact": "support@merchant.example"
}
```

<Note>
The `signature` field contains your secp256k1 signature of the canonicalized `config` object. This proves the configuration was set by the holder of your private key.
