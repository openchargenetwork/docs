## Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Open Charge protocol, documentation, APIs, SDKs, or any related materials ("Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Services.

## Nature of the Protocol

Open Charge is a **communication protocol specification** — it defines standards for how payment systems and devices communicate with each other. Open Charge:

- Does not process, hold, or transfer funds
- Does not operate wallets, payment services, or hardware devices
- Does not control or manage third-party implementations
- Does not guarantee compatibility between implementations

## Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

- Merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose
- Accuracy, reliability, or completeness of documentation
- Security, error-free operation, or uninterrupted availability
- Compatibility with your systems or requirements
- Compliance with any laws or regulations in your jurisdiction

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OPEN CHARGE AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY:

- Direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
- Loss of profits, data, business opportunities, or goodwill
- Damages arising from your use or inability to use the Services
- Damages arising from any third-party implementations of the protocol
- Damages arising from hardware or device behavior
- Damages arising from transaction failures, delays, or errors

This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and even if Open Charge has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

## Your Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for:

- **Implementation**: Ensuring your implementation of the protocol is correct, secure, and fit for your purposes
- **Security**: Implementing appropriate security measures, authentication, and access controls
- **Compliance**: Complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards in your jurisdiction
- **Testing**: Thoroughly testing your implementation before production use
- **Third-party services**: Evaluating and selecting any third-party wallets, payment providers, or hardware you integrate with
- **User agreements**: Establishing appropriate terms with your own users

## No Professional Advice

Nothing in the Services constitutes legal, financial, security, or professional advice. You should consult qualified professionals for guidance specific to your situation.

## Third-Party Implementations

Open Charge does not endorse, verify, audit, or guarantee any third-party implementations of the protocol. Any use of third-party wallets, SDKs, services, or devices is at your own risk.

## Modifications

Open Charge reserves the right to modify the protocol, documentation, or these terms at any time. Continued use of the Services after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified terms.

## Open Source

The Open Charge protocol and related materials are open source. Use of open source components is subject to their respective licenses.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Open Charge and its contributors from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the Services or your violation of these terms.

## Severability

If any provision of these terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in effect.
