## Overview

A Payment Gateway helps end users pay merchants. This includes wallet apps where users scan QR codes, as well as hosted checkout pages where users are redirected to complete purchases. Your users don't need their own OCID - they use your service to make payments.

## What You Build

As a payment gateway, you provide:

1. **Payment UI** - Hosted checkout pages or mobile wallet apps
2. **User management** - Maintain wallets or payment methods for your users
3. **Payment flows** - QR code scanning, checkout redirects, or both
4. **Settlement** - Send payment proofs to merchants or Merchant Gateways

## Base URL

Host your API at the endpoint you register in the Router Registry:

```
https://api.yourwallet.com/opencharge
```

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `/metadata.json` | GET | Your gateway's public metadata |
| `/capabilities` | GET | Partner-specific capabilities |
| `/checkout/create` | POST | Create hosted checkout session |
| `/orders/create/{sessionId}` | POST | Receive orders from merchants (QR flow) |
| `/transfer/create` | POST | Process transfers |
| `/transfer/webhook` | POST | Receive transfer notifications |

## Payment Flows

### 1. Hosted Checkout (Web Redirect)

Merchant Gateway sends an order to you. End user is redirected to your checkout page to complete payment.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Customer
    participant M as Merchant
    participant MG as Merchant Gateway
    participant YG as Your Gateway

    C->>M: 1. Checkout
    M->>MG: 2. POST /orders/checkout
    MG->>YG: 3. Forward order
    YG-->>MG: 4. checkout_url
    MG-->>M: 5. redirect_url
    M-->>C: 6. Redirect
    C->>YG: 7. Select payment method & pay
    YG->>MG: 8. Webhook (proof)
    MG->>M: 9. Webhook
    YG-->>C: 10. Redirect to success URL
```

### 3. Customer Displays QR (Merchant Scans)

Your app generates a QR code for the user. Merchant scans it to request payment.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant YA as Your App
    participant M as Merchant

    U->>YA: 1. Open app
    YA-->>U: 2. Display QR
    M->>YA: 3. Scan QR
    M->>YA: 4. POST order
    YA-->>U: 5. Approve?
    U->>YA: 6. Confirm
    Note over YA: 7. Process payment
    YA->>M: 8. Webhook
```

### 4. Merchant Displays QR (Customer Scans)

Merchant displays a QR code with order info. Customer scans and pays.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant YA as Your App
    participant M as Merchant

    M->>YA: 1. Display QR
    U->>YA: 2. Scan QR
    YA->>M: 3. Fetch order
    YA-->>U: 4. Confirm
    U->>YA: 5. Pay
    Note over YA: 6. Process payment
    YA->>M: 7. Webhook
```

## QR Code Format

### Your App's QR Code (for merchant to scan)

```json
{
  "ocid": 200,
  "order": "https://api.yourwallet.com/opencharge/orders/create/sess_abc123",
  "expiresAt": 1706400000
}
```

### Merchant's QR Code (for your app to scan)

```json
{
  "ocid": 500,
  "order": "https://api.merchant.com/opencharge/orders/ord_xyz789",
  "expiresAt": 1706400000
}
```

### Inventory QR Code (permanent)

```json
{
  "ocid": 500,
  "inventory": "https://api.merchant.com/opencharge/inventory",
  "expiresAt": null
}
```

## Settlement

To complete a payment, you need to settle with a provider the merchant accepts.

Check the order's `accepts` array:

```javascript
const order = await fetchMerchantOrder(qrData.order);

// Can we settle directly?
if (order.accepts.includes(YOUR_OCID)) {
  // Sign proof directly
  await sendProofToMerchant(order);
}

// Do we have a reserve with an accepted provider?
const commonProvider = findCommonProvider(YOUR_RESERVES, order.accepts);
if (commonProvider) {
  // Transfer via that provider
  const proof = await transferViaProvider(commonProvider, order);
  await sendProofToMerchant(order, proof);
}

// Need to find a settlement chain
const settlementChain = await findSettlementChain(order.accepts);
// ... resolve transfers through chain
```

## Authentication

Sign your requests with these headers:

| Header           | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `X-OC-ID`        | Your OCID                            |
| `X-OC-Timestamp` | Unix timestamp in seconds            |
| `X-OC-Nonce`     | Unique request identifier            |
| `X-OC-Signature` | Signature of canonical request       |

## Error Handling

Return errors in this format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS",
    "message": "User does not have enough balance"
  }
}
```

See [Error Codes](/guides/protocol/error-codes) for the complete list.
