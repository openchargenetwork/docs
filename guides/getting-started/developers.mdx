## Understanding Your Role

Before integrating with OpenCharge, identify which role(s) apply to your service. Each role implements different endpoints and has different responsibilities.

### Merchants

**You are a Merchant if:** You sell goods or services and need to accept payments.

Examples:  e-commerce stores, restaurants, retail POS, Vending machines, mobile top-up kiosks etc.

### Gateway Services

Gateways are services that facilitate payments between merchants and users. There are two types of gateway services. You can implement one or both, but they require separate API implementation on the OpenCharge network.
