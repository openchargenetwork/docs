## Introduction

Open Charge is a **payment interoperability protocol** — a common language that defines how payment services communicate with each other. Think of it like HTTP for the web, but for payments. It doesn't move money; it standardizes how payment systems talk about moving money.

The protocol is designed to be consumed by merchants (online, OTC) and wallet service providers like Venmo, MetaMask, Alipay, Safewallet and others. Once implemented, these services can seamlessly accept payments from or send payments to Opencharge merchants or other Opencharge-compatible wallets.

While end user developers can implement direct access to the protocol in their own systems, it's important to understand that wallet services retain full control over their transaction policies. They can still choose to allow transactions only with certain parties. Open Charge doesn't replace payment apps — it's simply a communication layer that any payment app can hook into.

## Hardware and Vending Device Support

Open Charge also defines a uniform communication API for hardware devices — vending machines, fuel pumps, EV chargers, parking meters, and more. This allows any Open Charge-compatible wallet or payment service to operate supported hardware through a standardized set of commands, without custom integrations for each manufacturer.

**Example:** Imagine MetaMask implements Open Charge merchant services, then MetaMask could potentially command an Open Charge-supported fuel pump to release 30 liters of fuel after confirming payment — without need for further development or manufacturer-specific integration by metamask or the merchant.

This removes the need for merchants to hire dedicated development teams for each device or payment provider combination.

## Key Principles

| Principle            | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interoperability** | Any compliant wallet can communicate with any other compliant wallet or device.              |
| **Sovereignty**      | Each participant retains full control over their security, policies, and partnerships.       |
| **Extensibility**    | The protocol can grow through community proposals without breaking existing implementations. |
| **Transparency**     | Capabilities and restrictions are published openly, so participants know what to expect.     |
