## Identity & Registration

**Q: Why use an NFT for identity?**

The NFT provides:

- **Permissionless registration**: Anyone can mint without approval
- **Ownership transfer**: Identity can be sold or transferred
- **On-chain record**: Tamper-proof registry of all OCIDs
- **Wallet compatibility**: Standard ERC-721, works with existing tools

**Q: Why not put the public key on-chain?**

Storing the public key in mutable metadata (via URL) allows key rotation without gas costs. If we stored keys on-chain, every rotation would require a transaction.

**Q: Can I have different keys for different endpoints?**

Currently, one OCID = one key pair. If you need isolated keys, register multiple OCIDs. Future versions may support delegated signing keys.

## Merchants

**Q: How do merchants accept payments via Opencharge?**

Merchants register their own OCID. This OCID becomes their universal payment address:

1. Merchant registers OCID (e.g., OCID 500)
2. Merchant hosts metadata with their public key and accepted settlement sources
3. Merchant shares OCID with payment services they want to accept (PayPal, Stripe, etc.)
4. Payment service onboards merchant by OCID—no API keys needed
5. Merchant can display OCID as QR code for in-person payments

```

Customer scans QR → their wallet fetches merchant's metadata → sees accepted settlement channels → initiates payment through a supported channel.

**Q: What's in a merchant's metadata?**

```json
{
  "opencharge": "0.1",
  "name": "Joe's Coffee Shop",
  "description": "Coffee and pastries in Kampala",
  "icon": "https://joescoffee.ug/logo.png",
  "publicKey": "a34b5c6d...",
  "endpoint": "https://api.joescoffee.ug/opencharge",
  "capabilities": ["payment.receive"],
  "settlement": {
    "currencies": ["UGX", "USD"],
    "accepts": [300, 301, 100]
  }
}
```

**Q: How does onboarding work without API keys?**

Traditional flow:

```
1. Merchant signs up on PayPal
2. PayPal generates API credentials
3. Merchant integrates credentials into their system
4. Credentials are PayPal-specific
```

Opencharge flow:

```
1. Merchant registers OCID once
2. Merchant tells PayPal: "My OCID is 500"
3. PayPal verifies merchant owns OCID (signed challenge)
4. PayPal approves OCID for payments
5. Same OCID works with Stripe, Square, anyone
```

The merchant's OCID and key pair replace per-service API credentials. One identity, universal acceptance.

**Q: Does every merchant need an OCID?**

Yes, for Opencharge protocol payments. The OCID is the merchant's identity in the protocol:

- All payment requests use `to: <merchant_ocid>`
- All transaction proofs reference the merchant's OCID
- The merchant receives signed proofs they can verify

The merchant registers ONE OCID and uses it everywhere. Each service provider (MTN, PayPal, Barclays) maps the merchant's OCID to their internal account:

```
Merchant OCID 500
├── MTN maps: OCID 500 → +256701234567 (internal)
├── PayPal maps: OCID 500 → merchant@email.com (internal)
└── Barclays maps: OCID 500 → account 12345678 (internal)
```

The protocol never exposes these internal identifiers—just the OCID.

**Q: What's the benefit for merchants?**

- **One identity**: Same OCID works across all payment services
- **No API key management**: No credentials to rotate per provider
- **QR payments**: Print OCID, accept payments from any compatible wallet
- **Portable**: Switch providers without changing payment address
- **Verifiable**: Customers can verify they're paying the right merchant

## Settlement & Trust

**Q: What if someone doesn't accept my settlement proof?**

If MTN doesn't accept proofs from your chosen settlement provider, you need to find another path. Check MTN's `settlement.accepts` list and find a provider you both work with. The protocol doesn't solve business relationships—it makes existing relationships more efficient.

**Q: Can PayPal route through multiple hops?**

Yes, but that's PayPal's internal concern. If PayPal doesn't have direct access to any of MTN's accepted sources, PayPal might:

1. Transfer to Wise (who has Barclays access)
2. Wise transfers to Barclays
3. Barclays credits MTN
4. PayPal presents Barclays' proof to MTN

MTN only sees and cares about the final hop (Barclays → MTN).

**Q: What about disputes?**

Out of scope. A valid signature from an accepted issuer means that issuer attests to completing the transfer. If there's a dispute (e.g., MTN claims Barclays' proof is valid but funds never arrived), that's between MTN and Barclays—a business relationship that exists independently of this protocol.

## Technical

**Q: How is this different from blockchain?**

| Aspect    | Blockchain           | Opencharge                    |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ledger    | Public, global       | Private, per-party            |
| Consensus | Network-wide         | Bilateral (signer + verifier) |
| Finality  | Block confirmation   | Signature verification        |
| Privacy   | Pseudonymous at best | Fully private                 |
| Speed     | Block time           | Instant                       |
| Cost      | Gas fees             | Free (except registration)    |

Opencharge gives you blockchain-style cryptographic receipts without the public ledger.

**Q: Why not just use traditional APIs with OAuth?**

Traditional API authentication:

- Requires bilateral key exchange per service
- Different credentials per integration
- No portable proof of payment
- Credentials tied to specific provider

Opencharge:

- One identity works everywhere
- No pre-shared secrets needed
- Proofs are portable and verifiable by third parties
- Self-sovereign identity

**Q: What happens if my metadata URL goes down?**

Other services won't be able to verify your signatures until it's back. Recommendations:

- Use highly available hosting (CDN, multiple regions)
- Implement caching on the verifier side
- Consider backup metadata URLs (future protocol extension)

**Q: How do QR code payments work?**

```
1. Customer scans merchant's QR code (contains OCID)
2. Customer's wallet fetches merchant metadata from registry
3. Wallet server verifies settlement paths for compartibility and picks one eg barclays.
4. Wallet displays: "Pay Joe's Coffee Shop 40$"
5. Wallet shows settlement options based on its collection methods
6. Customer selects payment method (e.g., "Pay via Card")
7. Wallet collects the payment via visa card.
6. Wallet server initiates payment flow with selected settlement path say via barclays.
7. Settlement completes, merchant receives proof
```

The QR code can be as simple as:

```
opencharge:500
```

Or include amount for specific transactions:

```
opencharge:500?amount=15000&currency=UGX&ref=order-123
```
