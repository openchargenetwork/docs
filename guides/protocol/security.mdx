## Private Key Security

Your OCID private key authenticates ALL your actions. Compromise means full impersonation.

**Requirements:**

- Store in HSM or secure enclave for production
- Never log or transmit private keys
- Implement key rotation via metadata update
- Monitor for unauthorized signatures

## Replay Protection

- **Requests**: Use unique nonces per request. Track nonces within timestamp window.
- **Proofs**: Track processed proof `txid`s. Reject duplicates.

## Metadata Security

- Always fetch via HTTPS
- Implement timeouts (5 seconds recommended)
- Cache with short TTL (5 minutes recommended)
- Validate schema before trusting

## Settlement Trust

Only add OCIDs to `settlement.accepts` for entities you have a real business relationship with. The protocol verifies cryptographic authenticity—it doesn't establish trust.
